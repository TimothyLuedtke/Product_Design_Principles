# Prototype Testing

- Test early and often!!!

## Testing Opportunities

low cost -> high cost

### Design

- Not on paper
- Wireframes
- Mockups
- Prototypes

### build

- Navigation
-Functionality

### post-launch

- bounce points
- places where users leave

## Test Recruitment

- Not anyone related to project or company
- Don't always need exact audience
- Many testing tools will recruit for you

## Minimum Testing Requirements

- Ensure real content is used

## Wireframe Testing

- 8 second test

- Agree on brand keywords

Options:

## Interactive Prototype Testing

### Unfacilitated testing

#### "Is it working" test

- Easy to set up and run
- User completes tasks without guidance
- Can be done remotely
- Can be done with a large number of users
- Encouraged to think out loud
- Sample tooling: [https://lookback.io/](Lookback)

### Facilitated testing

#### "Why isn't this working" test

- Clearly define your objectives
- Define realistic tests
- Prepare a script, but be flexible
- Work hard to relax people (they are not being tested)
- Encourage thinking out loud
- Remain neutral
- Answer questions at the end
- Show appreciation and gratitude
- Debrief quickly

- Clicks
- Scrolls
- Mouse movements

### Session Recordings
