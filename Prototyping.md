# Prototype Types

Low Fidelity

1. Paper
2. Wireframe(Greyscale)

High Fidelity

1. Visual
2. Interactive

Paper -> Wireframe -> Visual -> Interactive

# Design Sprints

## Considerations

- Can be hard to arrange
- Exhausting
- Can be expensive
- Can feel rushed

### Example: Crazy 8s exercise

1. Create two teams
    - fold paper into 8 sections
    - sketch 8 different ideas in 8 minutes

2. Pick the best 4 ideas
    - pick best 4 ideas within team

3. Combine ideas
    - combine ideas from both teams

4. Sketch the final idea
    - sketch the final idea

## Low Fidelity Prototyping

### Paper Prototyping

- Quick
- Cheap
- Easy to change
- Good for testing ideas

### Greyscale Wireframe

## Interactive Prototyping

- Realistic
- Interactive
- Functional

Sample tooling:

## Building Prototypes for Development

1. Always use AutoLayout
2. Don't forget to label states(components, buttons, etc.)
3. Include animations
4. Add annotations
