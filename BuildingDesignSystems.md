# Design Systems

A **Design System** is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

- **Consistency** - Ensure uniform design and functionality, enhancing user experience and brand identiy.

- **Efficiency and Speed** - Accellerates product evelopment with reusable components, enabling faster iterations.

- **Collaboration** - Improves teamwork with a shared language and understanding of design and development.

- **Quality** - Raises product quality by standardizing design and development practices.

- **Cost Reduction** - Reduces design and development costs by reusing components and patterns.

## Building Blocks of a Design System

### **Styles**

- **Typography** - Font family, size, weight, line height, and color.
- **Color** - Primary, secondary, and accent colors.
- **Spacing** - Margins, padding, and grid.
- **Iconography** - Icons and symbols.

### **Elements**

- **Buttons** - Primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons.
- **Inputs** - Text fields, text areas, and checkboxes.
- **Forms** - Form fields, labels, and validation messages.

### **Components**

- **Navigation** - Menus, tabs, and breadcrumbs.
- **Cards** - Containers for content.
- **Modals** - Dialogs and popups.

## Avoid buying a design system

- **Can be overengineered** - May include unnecessary components and styles.
- **Timeconsuming to learn** - May require time to understand and implement.
- **Needs customization** - May not fit your brand or product.
- **Result in bloated code** - May include unused components and styles.

**Caveat**: Buying a design system to speed up the creation of your design system can work. But avoid using their entire system as is.

## Get buy-in upfront

- **Collaborate with developes, desiges, product managers, and stakeholders** - Ensure everyone is on board with the design system.
- **Sell the benefits** - Explain how the design system will improve efficiency, consistency, and quality.
- **Set expectations** - Communicate the time and effort required to build and maintain the design system.

## Agree on Objectives

- **Define the Purpose** - Clarify the goals and objectives of the design system.

- **Set Scope** - Determine the components and styles to include in the design system.
- **Identify Audience** - Understand who will use the design system and their needs.

## Ask Questions Upfront

- **Accessibility** - Will the design system be accessible to all users?

- **Versioning** - How will you manage versions of the design system?

- **Responsiveness** - Will the design system be responsive for all devices?

- **Dark Mode** - Will the design system support dark mode?

## Auditing an Existing Application

- **Existing Assets** - Identify reusable components and styles.

- **Gaps and Inconsistencies** - Note gaps and inconsistencies in the design.

## Build as you go

- **Context** - Build components and styles as you need them is easier when you have context.

- **Focused** - Build components that you are using to keep the system focused and streamlined.

- **Faster and Cheaper** - Avoids the upfront investment in a system that may need larger revisions later.

## Creating a Design System

### **1. Define Styles**

- **Layout Grid** - Define the grid system for the design system.

- **Layout Padding** - Define padding within components.

- **Typography** - Define font sizes, weights, and line heights. (e.g., headings, body text, and links)

- **Color Palette** - Define primary, secondary, and accent colors, modes, and states through variables.

- **Aesthetic Styles** - Define rounded corners, shadows, and other aesthetic styles. (e.g., buttons, cards, and modals)

### **2. Create Elements**

- **Buttons** - Create primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons.

- **Inputs** - Create text fields, text areas, and checkboxes.

- **Forms** - Create form fields, labels, and validation messages.

- **etc.**

**Don't forget states** - Define states for each element (e.g., hover, focus, active, and disabled)

### **3. Build Components**

- **Navigation** - Create menus, tabs, and breadcrumbs.

- **Cards** - Create containers for content.

- **Modals** - Create dialogs and popups.

- **etc.**

**Avoid too much abstraction** - Keep components simple and focused on their purpose.

## Component Usage

- **Reuse** - Reuse components across applications.

- **Customization** - Customize components for specific use cases.

- **Consistency** - Ensure components are used consistently across applications.

- **Accessibility** - Ensure components are accessible to all users.

**Step back and look at them as a whole** - Ensure components work together harmoniously.

## Maintaining a Design System

- **User Feedback** - Collect feedback from users and stakeholders. Useful to highlight impormenets or reaveal usability issues.

- **Brand evolution** - Update the design system to reflect changes in brand identity.

- **Technology changes** - Update the design system to reflect changes in technology.

- **Component updates** - Update components to improve usability and accessibility.

## Process to Update a New Component

### **1.Research**

- Can we reuse an existing component?
- Can we revise an existing component?
- Anyone working on a similar component?

### **2. Design**

### **3. Development**

### **4. Testing**

## **Maintaining Version Control**

- **Clear versioning strategy** - Use semantic versioning to manage versions of the design system.

- **Documentation changes** - Update documentation to reflect changes in the design system.

- **Rolloutstrategy** - Plan how to roll out changes to the design system.

- **Depreciation strategy** - Plan how to deprecate components and styles.

## **Adoption and Communication**

- **Communicate Value** - Explain the benefits of the design system to users and stakeholders.

- **Chamions** - Identify champions to promote the design system within the organization.

- **Ownership** - Assign ownership of the design system to a team or individual.

- **Training** - Provide training on how to use the design system.

## **Design Principles**

**Design principles are a framwork that can help make design decisions, ensuring yout service is user-centric and fir for purpose.**

### **Design principles provide:**

- Consistent decision-making
- A shared understanding of what good looks like
- A way to evaluate design decisions

## Digital Playbook

**A digital playbook is a set of guidelines that help teams design and deliver better digital services.**

### **Provides:**

- Agreed set of processes
- A shared understanding of how to deliver digital services
- A way to evaluate the success of digital services
