# Interface Fundamentals

## Limit Options

- We can only hold 4 items in our short-term memory, so limit the number of options you show at any time.

- Focus on the top tasks, with the ability for the user to access other options of required.

Example menu or dropdown:

- Choice 1
- Choice 2
- Choice 3
- More...

## Chunking

- If you can't reduce the number of options, group them into chunks.

## Progressive Disclosure

- Break more complex interactions into smaller steps.
- (don't forget to implement Limited Options and Chunking)

## Good Defaults

- Make the most common option the default.

## Prioritise Critical Information

- Make sure the most important information is the most prominent.
- Don't distract the user with secondary information.
